## Project/Goals
	To be able to understand the data from a analytical stand point to gain insights on the trends and patterns and any areas of improvement if needed and depict in in simpler visuals.

## Process
	
	I decided to look closely at the  the AirBnB data set as being from the hospitality background I though it may be just a little easier for me to build questions and answer them. As mentioned earlier not being able to quickly get analytical question I first started creating some basic visuals and the more visuals I made, various questions started poppin and I adjusted my visuals to answer them to the best of my abilities.

 

	My aproach with creating dashboards was as though I was presenting this data to the stakeholders of AirBnB.
	Due to the nature of this project I have tried my best to write my findings and understanding of each visualization in the caption portion of the tableau worksheets.

	I connected to the data source in Tableau using text file and started to explore if all the formats of the columns were correct. After a few hurdles of plotting the regions on the map I found that the neighbourhood had to be under the county category in geographical format to be able to plot it correctly. The host Id was changed to string as it was not going to be used for any calulations.
	
	Selecting the item on a worksheet should give the option to navigate to its particular dashboard.

## Results

 	The first thing in mind was to compare the different regions involved in this data to get a in depth analysis if one region is doing better than the other and from the visualization presented in the Income Generated and Forecasting Dashboard it was clear that Manhattan and Brooklyn where doing much better in terms of business than Bronx,Queens and Staten Island.

	Price was not the only numerical category but reviews and ratings for these regions was also better which can be see in the Top Performing Host Dashboard. 

	I grouped the property type further into standard stay and unique stay to differentiate it on the accomodation experience from a customer stand point and seeing as this data set is for New York it shows us that standard stay properties are more available being in a busy city. this can be viewed in the Property Classification worksheet as well as the overview dashboard.

	The over time progress of AIRBNB can be seen in the Current Air BnB standings Dashboard, on how the trend of increase can be seen for the different regions and how there was a big boom near to 2011 for Brooklyn and Manhattan

	During all this and the EDA process of looking for NULL values , you can see in the EDA-Dashboard that the review ratings has almost 25% null values which cannot be ignored and reflects upon an area 	of concern. it clearly indicated that customers need to be encouraged to leave ratings after their stay and that it is not due just an imcomplete nature of the attribute.


## Challenges 
	When I first started this project I was keen on the housing data set in Canada, understanding the technical terms possed as a challenge in order to be able to potrait the trends and patterns. 
	Thats when I changed my approach to AIRBNB data, as it was related to my expertise. Plotting those regions took a bit of time to find the right category under geographical format. the next big challenge was how to frame questions on what I need the visualizations to answer so I first tried to make the answers and then create the questions around it .

	Knowing what is a part of the EDA process and analytical process still seems like something I may not have differentiated. it seemed a lot easier in python but this was a relatively cleaner data set as 	supposed to what we have worked in the past and hence also I think i found it more difficult to specify something particular as a part of EDA. 
	
	Every new worksheet I was creating felt like and EDA process as it gave me new insights into the nature of the data that I was looking into. Eg how only Staten Island had any properties with 3 beds/multiple accomodation which can be seen in the Housing Styles in NewYork worksheet. 


## Future Goals
	I would have given more time to figure out option 1 so as to improve on the aspect of joing data from different files and sources, but given that I proceeded with option 2 I would have done the EDA process in python so as to give me an idea while working with tableau for what I should be looking for as a result . Found more patterns and trends in this data set
